"""@file serial_worker.py
@brief Background serial I/O so the GUI thread never blocks (spec 7: "usar threading").

SerialWorker owns the pyserial port. Its read loop runs in a QThread and talks to the GUI
only through Qt signals (thread-safe, delivered on the GUI thread). Writes are serialised
with a lock so any widget may call send() directly from the GUI thread.

Anything that reconfigures the port instead of writing to it - request_baud() - is queued
and applied by the read loop between two reads, because the loop is normally blocked inside
readline() and reconfiguring underneath it corrupts that read.
