/**

 * @brief Frame layer shared by both directions of the serial link.
 *
 * Frame format (ASCII, one frame per line):
 *
 *     $<payload>*<XX>\n
 *
 * - `payload`: comma-separated fields, the first one is the message type (e.g. "CFG,X,1,4,100")
 * - `XX`: two upper-case hex digits = XOR of every payload byte (between '$' and '*')
 *
 * This file only knows about framing and checksums. Message types and their fields are
 * defined in README.md ("Protocolo") and handled in commands.c / accel_sim.c / env_sim.c.
 * gui_python/protocol.py mirrors this exactly - keep both in sync.
